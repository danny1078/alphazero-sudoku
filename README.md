# cAlphaZero (ESE 5460 Final Project)

This documents our course project for ESE 5460, Principles of Deep Learning. 

We examine the effect of curriculum scheduling in an AlphaZero-like training process, for Sudoku. See the [report](https://github.com/danny1078/alphazero-sudoku/blob/main/report/report.pdf) for further details.

Some of the code structure is based on the [alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) repository, and much of the implementation was changed to fit the single-player, curriculum-scheduled setting and adapt it to Sudoku.
